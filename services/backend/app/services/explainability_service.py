Recommendation Explainability Service.

This module provides personalized explanations for recommendations using
template-based approach (not LLM). Templates are more efficient, consistent,
and cost-effective than generating explanations via LLM for every recommendation.

The service analyzes user history, product details, and recommendation context
to select and populate appropriate explanation templates.
